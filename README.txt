This is a demo tutor site using the Spring Boot framework and a MySQL database for data storage.

This site contains nearly all the required features, such as student and teacher account registration and login, 
tutor session scheduling, setting a tutor's schedule, and a view to view all booked sessions.

I unfortunatley did not have time to add the in-app notification of a booked lesson, 
as well as the ability to view a tutor's schedule.

Should have I been given more time, I would have implemented these features, as well as made the following changes:
	-Changed the views to display more display names instead of ids
	-Added more boundary checking and error checking in general
	-Added duplicate name handling, as well as checking for sessions scheduled for the same date and time
	-Added a button link to the register page (currently bound to the manual URL localhost:8080/register)
	-Implemented a lesson cancel function
